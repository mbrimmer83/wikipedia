    <h1>The early days</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Dallas Georgia and attended Pauling County High School. I played sports and always had an interest in
        computers. After a few years of installing windows and doors, I decided to attend college and discovered my love for chemistry
        while attending KSU.
      </p>
      <h3>My Hobbies and Favorites</h3>
      <p>I have always loved the Atlanta Braves and I am also a huge golf junky and play whenever possible.
